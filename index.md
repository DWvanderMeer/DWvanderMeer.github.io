I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher with the Centre for Processes, Renewable Energy Systems [PERSEE](https://www.persee.minesparis.psl.eu/Accueil/Presentation/) at MINES Paris, PSL University, in France. My research focuses on probabilistic forecasting of renewable energy generation, especially distributed solar power and wind power, in the frame of the European Horizon 2020 project [Smart4RES](https://www.smart4res.eu). However, I work on applications of probabilistic forecasting as well, most notably stochastic optimisation and optimal bidding.

Furthermore, I contribute to [Task 16](https://iea-pvps.org/research-tasks/solar-resource-for-high-penetration-and-large-scale-applications/) of the International Energy Agency's Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme. Task 16 is an international collaboration to define best practises, enhance analysis of long-term inter-annual variability and improve probabilistic and variability forecasting.

Prior to my current employment, I was as a PhD student with the [Department of Civil and Industrial Engineering](https://www.cie.uu.se/?languageId=1) at Uppsala University in Sweden. There, my research focused on spatio-temporal probabilistic forecasting of solar power and electricity demand in the built environment, as well as applications thereof such as stochastic model predictive control. A digital copy of my dissertation is available on [DiVA](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1502409). During my time as a PhD student, I also worked as an external consultant with [Greenlytics](https://greenlytics.io) to investigate the potential of very short-term solar power forecasting using [satellite imagery](https://github.com/rebase-energy/satellite-forecast) in Sweden.
