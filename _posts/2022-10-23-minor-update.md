It's been a while since last I posted something and I do intend to keep this blog alive. In my main research I'm now focussing on online convex optimisation, which I find very interesting. I might post a high-level introduction to the topic here soon.

In the meantime, I've been working on some [codility](https://github.com/DWvanderMeer/codility) exercises. These were, however, more challenging than anticipated! In any case, I'll keep pushing with these exercises as well as the analysis on the La Haute Borne wind power data set.

Stay tuned!
