Today I noticed on ResearchGate that my publications have been cited exactly 1000 times! I'm very grateful that I've been able to contribute to the very exciting and quickly evolving field of probabilistic solar forecasting. And of course, it wouldn't have been possible without all my collaborators. Thank you!
