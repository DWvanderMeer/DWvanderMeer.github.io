It's been a while since last I posted something and I do intend to keep this blog alive. I've been applying to tenure track positions recently and this is quite time consuming.

Because of that, I've had to update my academic CV and I have now made this available [here](https://dwvandermeer.github.io/academic_cv.pdf) on my website. Go check it out if you're interested! This will be regularly updated in case of, e.g., new teaching experience or new publications.

Stay tuned!
