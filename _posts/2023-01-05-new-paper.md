It’s well known that co-locating wind power and solar power plants makes economical sense because they can share an interconnection point and make more effective use of land. In this new study, led by Oskar Lindberg, we show that co-location has another benefit, namely improved forecast quality and value. Since the correlation between solar power and wind power is often close to zero or even negative, the combined signal tends to be smoother than the separate signals. 

We show that for a case study in Varberg (Sweden), a ratio of about 50-60% wind power and the remainder solar power improves forecast quality the most. And this translates nicely into the added value in the day-ahead market by reducing the regulation costs because the deviations from the contracted energy production are lower!

The article, titled “Day-ahead probabilistic forecasting at a co-located wind and solar power park in Sweden: Trading and forecast verification" is open-access and can be [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666792422000385?utm_campaign=STMJ_AUTH_SERV_PUBLISHED&utm_medium=email&utm_acid=245567581&SIS_ID=&dgcid=STMJ_AUTH_SERV_PUBLISHED&CMX_ID=&utm_in=DM329951&utm_source=AC_).
