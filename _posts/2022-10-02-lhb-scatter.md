A minor update on the [data analysis](https://github.com/DWvanderMeer/LaHauteBorne/blob/main/scripts/lhb.ipynb) of the La Haute Borne wind power measurements, which is progressing slowly due to time constraints. In the figure, we can see the wind speed versus the wind power produced by the four different wind turbines. I've already removed negative power and power above the nominal capacity but anomalies remain (e.g., zero power production during nonzero wind speed conditions).

Next time I'll try to impute or remove these critical instances. Stay tuned!
